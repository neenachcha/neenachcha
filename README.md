### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ About me:

I founded Cloveaudit in 2018 and am currently working as a partner auditor. Cloveaudit is a small audit company, and it's only busy from Feb - June each year. During those non-busy times, I pursued my passion for coding. I like how coding can bring an idea to life. I love and want to be able to help make people's life quality better with my problem-solving and creative skills.
